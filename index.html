            My favorite hobby is reading books.I like reading adventure books.Recently,I read a story book.That story book's name is "Chander Pahar".The hero of the story is shankar.The author of the story is "Bibhutibhusan Bandopadhdhay".The hero of the story struggles to go the jungle of africa.But,he had to face many difficulties in doing the task.He had to face many dangerous animals.And he was not going alone,he also he had a friend who was going to africa with him.But,in their way,Shankar's friend was killed  by a dangerous animal.The animal mostly looked like a chimpanzee.The book conatined many pages.At first,I was not interested in the book,and wanted to buy a book called "Feluda".But one day,I thought of reading the book.Then I got interested in it.I read story books after completing my homework.
